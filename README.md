# Final-year-project
Here are the instructipons for carrying out testing of my project
the programme can either be started by running in an application that contains python i.e. Idle or the python file can be run in the terminal

# If running from terminal:
run line "Python3 Project_code_Blender.py"

# Once the programme has been started it will ask for an input of the frames you would like to test to.
-i recommened inputting either 100 or 250 (250 being a longer period to test within) however any number can be used

# Choose between which test you want to complete (tests 2 and 3 will take minimum 2 hours)
- Test 1 : if you would like to enter all the details, this includes the number of cards used per level and the  angke and of card in your personalised simulation
- Test 2 : if you would like to make use of the optimisation portion of the programme, however still have control of the number of cards used per level.
- Test 3: if you would like to make use of the optimisation portion of the programme, using already set variables.
